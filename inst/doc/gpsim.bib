  abstract = {MOTIVATION: Inference of latent chemical species in biochemical interaction
	networks is a key problem in estimation of the structure and parameters
	of the genetic, metabolic and protein interaction networks that underpin
	all biological processes. We present a framework for Bayesian marginalization
	of these latent chemical species through Gaussian process priors.
	RESULTS: We demonstrate our general approach on three different biological
	examples of single input motifs, including both activation and repression
	of transcription. We focus in particular on the problem of inferring
	transcription factor activity when the concentration of active protein
	cannot easily be measured. We show how the uncertainty in the inferred
	transcription factor activity can be integrated out in order to derive
	a likelihood function that can be used for the estimation of regulatory
	model parameters. An advantage of our approach is that we avoid the
	use of a coarsegrained discretization of continuous time functions,
	which would lead to a large number of additional parameters to be
	estimated. We develop exact (for linear regulation) and approximate
	(for non-linear regulation) inference schemes, which are much more
	efficient than competing sampling-based schemes and therefore provide
	us with a practical toolkit for model-based inference. AVAILABILITY:
	The software and data for recreating all the experiments in this
	paper is available in MATLAB from http://www.cs.man. ac.uk/~neill/gpsim.},
